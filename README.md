# Chronicles of the Summer Olympics: A Historical Analysis Across Decades

## Introduction

Research the Summer Olympics in this data-oriented way and have decades of transformations within reach. Focus on the role of countries hosting the event, analyze medals and how well different participants do over the years, measure differences based on gender. Get into the depth of the topic by numbers and find out the most profound advice about the event in question, and its history and influence globally.


## Data Collection
The information obtained from major platforms like Kaggle and Wikipedia was subjected to a thorough fact-checking exercise with the [IOC(International Olympic Committee)](https://https://www.olympics.com/ioc) website serving as the point of reference. Such a stringent process sought to ensure that data was accurate and reliable, therefore, generating a feeling of assuredness that the data undergirding the discourses was accurate.

## Objectives 
Overall, the dataset’s objectives include thorough analysis and exploration of numerous aspects of the Summer Olympics, such as historical perspectives, performance metrics, effects of host countries, patterns of medal-winning, gender disparities, and dominant sports. By conducting detailed reviews, the dataset seeks to draw conclusions that can shed light on how the event’s underlying story has become notable for several centuries.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- I began the data analysis process by loading the dataset into Power query, providing a clearer view of its structure and contents.
- Scanned for duplicity, null entries, and inconsistent data entries and it was discovered to be a clean data except for some balnk spaces in the medal column which i filled with "No medal"
- Countries such as East and West Germany, which participated separately in earlier Olympics but later merged, were consolidated into a single entity for cohesive analysis.

**2. Athlete Demography and Performance Trend**:In the dataset, a noticeable trend emerges as there is a significant gap between the number of male and female athletes. The USA showed the widest difference, boasting 3710 more male athletes. Across all 223 teams, male athlete counts varied from 1 to 6147, while females ranged from 1 to 2437. Males received considerably more medals, totaling 25754 compared to females' 10804, constituting 70.45% of the total. In the Tokyo 2020 games, male athletes accounted for 3.58%, while female athletes accounted 3.52% of the total medals awarded over the years and On average, males won more medals (888.07) than females (385.86). The most significant gender difference was observed in the 1920 Antwerpen games, with 1228 more medals awarded to males athletes. Additionally, the average age of medal winners was 26 for males and 24 for females, aligning with the average age of participating athletes, which stands at 26 years.

**3. Teams Performance insight**:There is a clear correlation between the number of sports each team participates in and the number of medals they win. This is evident with the USA participating in 63 sports over the years, ultimately making them the highest medal-winning team with 5213 medals. Additionally, their dominance in athletics, with 4160 medals won, further supports this correlation.

Host countries tend to perform well at the games. Over 29 Summer Olympic Games, host countries have accounted for 11% of the total medals awarded.

The United States accounted for 25.05% of the total medals awarded at the Olympics, solidifying their position as the most successful team.

### Conclusion and Prediction

In conclusion, the analysis reveals intriguing correlations between various factors influencing Olympic success. Notably, there is a clear link between the number of sports a team participates in and their medal count, exemplified by the USA's extensive participation across 63 sports, resulting in their status as the highest medal-winning team with 5213 medals. Moreover, host countries consistently demonstrate strong performances, accounting for 11% of total medals awarded across 29 Summer Olympic Games.

Furthermore, the demographic makeup of athletes and their performance trends provide valuable insights. The average age of medal winners, standing at 26 years for males and 24 years for females, mirrors the average age of participating athletes. This indicates that athletes tend to peak in performance during their mid-20s, aligning with physiological factors and years of training leading up to the Olympics. Additionally, the dominance of certain sports, such as athletics for the USA, underscores the importance of specialization and strategic focus in achieving success.

Looking ahead, these trends suggest that countries with diverse athletic programs and strong support systems for athletes across various sports disciplines are likely to continue excelling on the Olympic stage. As advancements in sports science and technology continue to evolve, we can expect to see new records being set and athletes pushing the boundaries of human performance in future Olympic Games.
